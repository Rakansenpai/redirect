# Redirect

## Usage

1. Set ENV Variable `REDIRECTS`
   1. Examples:
      ```shell
      REDIRECTS="google>https://google.com|discord>https://discord.gg/d5N7JwzPgt" 
       ```
   > NOTE! both `>` and `|` are not URL safe, these are used to designate how the app breaks the variable up. 
   > You can include newlines in the variable to make it easier to read. 
   > 
2. Launch the redirect agent.
